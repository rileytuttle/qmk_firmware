things needed to start up i2c connection with bluetooth dev board

using MICRO_OLED as an example
inside rules.mk file add something that looks like:
QWIIC_ENABLE += MICRO_OLED

inside qwiic.h we need to add an entry
#ifdef QWIIC_MICRO_OLED_ENABLE
#   include "micro_led.h"
#endif

inside qwiic.c init function add
#ifdef QWIIC_MICRO_OLED_ENABLE
    micro_oled_init();
#endif
from there add functions to init the bluetooth and do whatever with it
for starters just communicate with the board
then figure out how to connect the board to a bluetooth master (ie. the computer)
then configure the board as a usb device and then set up as passthrough
