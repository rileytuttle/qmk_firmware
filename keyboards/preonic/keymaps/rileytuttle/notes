things needed to start up i2c connection with bluetooth dev board

using MICRO_OLED as an example
inside rules.mk file add something that looks like:
QWIIC_ENABLE += MICRO_OLED

inside qwiic.h we need to add an entry
#ifdef QWIIC_MICRO_OLED_ENABLE
#   include "micro_led.h"
#endif

inside qwiic.c init function add
#ifdef QWIIC_MICRO_OLED_ENABLE
    micro_oled_init();
#endif
from there add functions to init the bluetooth and do whatever with it
for starters just communicate with the board
then figure out how to connect the board to a bluetooth master (ie. the computer)
then configure the board as a usb device and then set up as passthrough


I think the music stuff isn't working because it isn't using my music_mask_user() function. I think that it is still using the MUSIC

that is definitely the problem with the music mask. it is just using the default music mask thing instead of what I have defined. so I need to figure out where to do that undefining of MUSIC_MASK

now that it is using the correct music_mask_user, we need to make it stop interpreting the layer key as a layer

first check to see how far down the layer key is interpreted

so I'm pretty sure I figured out how to make it work but I don't know why I need to change something to make it work. So im pretty sure that if I put inside the process_record_user that if we are in music mode don't process the certain layer keys. that should fix it. I should just have to figure out how to find the current layer

my idea worked but I still gotta figure out why the original music_mask_user didn't work.
